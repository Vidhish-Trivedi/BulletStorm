## Features
- This is a single-level, single-player game.
- The game features multiple enemies who shoot at the player, moving platforms which the player can use to move onto higher platforms.
- The player has a health indicator.
- The game has sounds which play persistently as well as based on some event (firing a bullet).

## Requirements and Running the Project
- Maps for this game were created using Tiled Map Editor, it uses assets and sounds from multiple sources online.
- The project uses the following libraries as dependencies (can be sourced from https://pypi.org/)
    - pygame
    - os (usually part of Python 3.x installations)
    - math (usually part of Python 3.x installations)
    - sys (usually part of Python 3.x installations)
    - pytmx (https://pypi.org/project/PyTMX/)
- Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the game by:
```
python main.py
```
